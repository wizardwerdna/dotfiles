# my-angular-seed

My-angular-seed is a project, derived from the [Yeoman angular project build](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).  This seed is "good to go," for my TDD/bdd development and set up for easy Heroku deployment.  It 

* has 1.2.x AngularJS build; 
* has a specially configured grunt server for use with single page applications;
* assumes you are building the application from scratch, there is no initial application scaffold apart from a very thin `index.html` and a trivial `app.js`.  
You can still use the yeoman scaffolding commands, but its not my practice.
* has karma installed and configured to use ngRoute, and angular-test-scaffold.

## Installation

Assuming you have installed node, and globally installed generator-angular, you can start cooking with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wizardwerdna/my-angular-seed.git <your-directory-here>
cd <your-directory-here>
npm install && bower install
```

Proceed at your own pace and style.  I tend to fire up tmux, run 'grunt server', and in a new page begin editing an integration test, usually
named something like `test/spec/integrations/integration.js` or the like.  I will blog on my style for developing angularjs apps shortly.

## Single Page Application Development Server

The default server configured with generator-angular fires up a browser, runs the application, and monitors the app directory for changes, with liveupdates upon change.
However, when your SPA application attempts to reload an internal route, such as //foo/first/second/third, the server does not recognize this as a static file, and
returns a 404.  Thus, when you are testing an internal page and the browser liveupdates, you end up getting a 404, and must restart your app from scratch.  The server
configured with my-angular-seed passes the 404 to the SPA, so that it can route and respond as you see fit.

## Heroku Deployment

A basic node webserver and procfile are provided to facilitate deployment of the app to heroku.  You might find deployment straightforward with the following strategy:

1.  Install the heroku toolkit, if you haven't already done so.
1.  Create and initialize your new application on Heroku.

```bash
heroku create <your-app-name>
```

1.  Each time you are ready to deploy:

```bash
grunt build
git add -A
git commit -m "<your message identifying the new build>"
git push heroku master
```

1.  After deployment, run the application wth

```bash
heroku open

# if that fails, try
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku open
```

## TDD AngularJS Cheat Sheet

*  [**angular.mock.module**](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.mock.module)
*  [**angular.mock.inject**](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.mock.inject)
*  [**$rootScope**](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope)
*  [**$compile**](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$compile)

These can be used to construct a dynamic DOM fragment running angular, ideal for integration and directive testing:

```javascript
var app;
beforeEach( module ( 'app' ) );
beforeEach( inject( function($compile, $rootScope) {
  $compile(
    '<h1>Great HTML Definition for the Fragment</h1>'
  )($rootScope.$new);
  $rootScope.$digest();
});
```

*  [**$controller**](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$controller);

This can be used to construct a controller unit test

```javascript
var $scope;

beforeEach( module ( 'app' ) );
beforeEach( inject( function($controller, $rootScope) {
  $scope = $rootScope.$new();
  $controller( 'CtrlCtrl', {
    $scope: $scope,
    dittyService: mockDittyService
    ...
  }
});
```

*  [**$injector.get**](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/AUTO.$injector)

This is helpful for obtaining arbitrary objects, its really a matter of style whether to do:

```javascript
var cerveza;
beforeEach( module( 'app' ) );
beforeEach( inject( function(_cerveza_) {
  cerveza = _cerveza_;
}));
```

or:

```javascript
var cerveza;
beforeEach( module( 'app' ) );
beforeEach( inject( function($injector) {
  cerveza = injector.get('cerveza');
}));
```

* **$provide**(http://docs.angularjs.org/api/AUTO.$provide)

This is helpful for initializing, overriding or setting dependencies relied upon in the application, an excellent vehicle to store test doubles.

```javascript
beforeEach ( module( 'app', function($provide) {
  $provide.value( 'valeu', function() {} );
}));
```

For test purposes, this sets `valeu` to the defined function for the purpose of running tests in a module.

Enjoy.
