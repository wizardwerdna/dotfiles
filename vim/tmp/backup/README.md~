# Superheroic Tallying

In this kata, we will build out a browser-based tally counter.  Using
Test-First disciplines, we will build applications built from scratch,
starting with an empty file. From the simplest examples to full-scale
AngularJS and backend systems, I hope these katas may inspire you to
adopt these terrific agile practices to change the world with your own
examples and craftsmanship.

I will perform each kata for you in a screencast and in written materials
summarizing the development. Then it is your turn.
Correct performance has nothing to do with mimicking what I show you,
but by finding your own chops and improving on the craft.

We repeat katas to better comprehend the practices and to build mental
muscle memory so that skills flow quickly from your mind, as though you
were touch typing the ideas themselves. They should take your breath
away, as can a Mozart aria.

My name is Andrew Greenberg, and I would be grateful for your comments
and suggestions as you work through these forms. You can find me by
e-mail at wizardwerdna@gmail.com, or at @wizardwerdna on twitter. Now,
let's get this kata started.

## The Plan

This application is very simple, primarily to illustrate the basic Bunkai
for any TDD-developed application in AngularJS.  I will go into great details
about the techniques used here, so that we can skip past them quickly in later
kata.  The plan is to build out a web page with the following:

1.  Provide a display of a tally count.
2.  Provide a means for incrementing the tally count.
3.  Provide a means for resetting the tally count.

## First tests 

We begin, as we always do, with an empty file.  We would like to write some 
production code, but we cannot until we have a failing test.  (See Bunkai-The TDD Process).  So we will write some outside-in integration tests to begin our work.

```javascript
describe('a tally count display', function(){
  it('SCENARIO: upon creation', function(){
    expect(parseInt(page.find('.count').text())).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

This is a "hail-mary" test that makes reference to structures that don't exist.
The idea is that the errors thrown by the test will compel us to Fake it Until
We Make It.  The general idea is that we are going to "scrape" text from the web
page, convert it to a number, and the result should be 0.  This gives us our
first error (a compile message);

```bash
ReferenceError: can't find 'page'
```

So we define page.

```javascript
describe('a tally count display', function(){
  var page;
  it('SCENARIO: upon creation', function(){
    expect(return parseInt(page.find('.count').text())).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

But that isn't enough, the next message requires more:

```bash
TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'page.find')
```

So we make page an object with:

```javascript
...
var page = {};
...
```

Nope, that isn't it either:

```bash
TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'page.find('.count')')
```

So we add property `find` and an empty function.

```javascript
...
var page = {find: function(){}};
...
```
Still not there.

```bash
TypeError: `undefined`` is not an object (evaluating 'page.find('.count').text')
```

So we start building page out as a find on a jQuery object:

```javascript
...
var page = {find: function(sel){return $().find(sel}};
...
```

and the angels sing:

```bash
Expected NaN to be 0.
```

An expectation failure at last!  Now we have permission to write some code.
Where will we put it?  For now, just to get green, let's put it in the
space between the parentheses:

```javascript
...
var page = {find: function(sel){return $(
    '<div>\
      <div class="count">0</div>\
    </div>'
).find(sel}};
...
```

and our code is green at last!   There are a number of opportunities to
refactor here.  First of all, the text simply doesn't belong in our
code.  So we move the object into a separate property on page, and use 
the Angular-specific Bunkai to move the text into a separate file, index.html.

To facilitate this, we rewrite our page object to have a separate property,
element, for storing the page element, and then using the `$templateCache`,
`$compile` and `$rootScope` services to load, compile and instantiate a working
Subject Under Test.

```javascript

...
var page = {
  element: null,
  find: function(selector){return page.element.find(selector);}
...

beforeEach(function(){
  module('index.html');
  inject(function($templateCache, $compile, $rootScope){
    page.element = $compile($templateCache.get('index.html')($rootScope);
    $rootScope.$digest();
  });
}
...
```

and index.html now contains

```html
<div>
  <div class=count">0</div>
</div>
```

One last thing, we take a look at the test code, and see that the expectation
is virtually unreadable.  Worse, it contains detailed selectors from the 
page that may change over time.  We don't want our tests littered with such 
details, but would prefer that they be contained in one place.  So we refactor 
those details into the page object.

```javascript
...
var page = {
  element: null,
  find: function(selector){return page.element.find(selector);},
  count: function(){return parseInt(page.find('.count').text());}
};

it('SCENARIO: upon creation', function(){
  expect(page.count()).toBe(0);
});
...
```
See how much more clearly our tests read?  This capacity to abstract our tests
is one of the great features of the Page Object Pattern.

## Finishing the application.

It is now time to clear that slime out of our application.  We do this with 
another test:

```javascript
it('SCENARIO: after clicking tally button', function(){
  page.tallyClick();
  expect(page.count()).toBe(1);
});
```

Hopefully, the test speaks for itself.  We click on the tally button, and 
the count display should read "1" instead of "0".  Our next message complains
that we don't have page.tallyClick, so we define it:

```javascript
var page = {
  ...
  tallyCount: function(){page.find('.tally').click();}
}

```

and we are good to go with an expectation failure:

```bash
Expect 1 to be 0.
```

We can't slime the 1 for the 0 without breaking our previous test, 
so we need to generalize.  We write some code:

```html2ng
<div>
  <div class="count" ng-init="count=0">{{count}}</div>
  <div class="tally" ng-click="count=1"></div>
</div>
```

And we are green.  The `ng-init` directive initially sets count to be 0,
and the `ng-click` sets count to be 1 when the tally <div> is clicked.
Note that we might have written a more complex bit of code, but then
test did not require it, so we slimed with a "1" and we are good to go.

No worries!  We will lose the slime with our next test.

```javascript
it('SCENARIO: after twice clicking tally button', function(){
  page.tallyClick();
  page.tallyClick();
  expect(page.count()).toBe(2);
});
```

Repeating the earlier test with a more specific or another example 
is a common trick for forcing generalization.  (As the tests get
more specific, the code gets more generic!)  In this case, we are 
faced with a few "slimy" solutions, but none as clear and elegant
as the more general solution.

```html2ng
...
<div class="tally" ng-click="count=count+1"></div>
...
```

We have just the reset functionality to build out now.  The test 
(and the corresponding `page.resetClick` function) follow:

```javascript
var page = {
  ...
  tallyCount: function(){page.find('.tally').click();}
}

it('SCENARIO: after clicking reset button', function(){
  page.tallyReset();
  expect(page.count()).toBe(0);
});
```

But something funny happens.  Without writing a line of production
code, this test passes!  Why?  Because the value of count is already
initially 0.  This test tests nothing, and does not give us any permission
to write production code.  (You can only write production code with a **failing** 
test.)  So we fix this by addng a tallyclick at the beginning, and get then
message:

```bash
Expected 1 to be 0.
```

This is solved with the following code, includin a slimed 0:

```html
<div>
  <div class="count" ng-init="count=0">{{count}}</div>
  <div class="tally" ng-click="count=count+1"></div>
  <div class="reset" ng-click="count=0"></div>
</div>
```

and we are green!  Since the slimed 0 is, in fact, the desired code here, we 
have completed the application.  We add some detail and styling
to the html application, as shown in the repository code, and we are finished
with the build-out.

Bunkai -- Breakdown and Application of Techniques
-------------------------------------------------

### Angular- and Karma-Specific Techniques

Superheroic Tallying makes use of a number of technical "tricks" that
are helpful in the Karma/Angular environment.  In other environments,
you will do similar things, but in different ways.

*   **Importing html text without a server.**  AngularJS and Karma facilitate
    collecting text from html files without the use of a server.  This
    makes it easy and fast to run integration and unit tests from within
    Karma.  Karma automatically preprocesses your HTML files into 
    modules that load up the \$templateCache, using the filename as themselves
    module name.  Thus, you can load html code code into a DOM fragment:

    ```javascript
        beforeEach(function(){
          module('index.html');
          inject(function($templateCache){
            globalPageVar = $(
              $templateCache.get('index.html')
            )
          });
        }
    ```

    The code instructs AngularJS to load the preprocessed HTML files
    into the \$templateCache, and then uses the cache (the `get` function)
    to return the text of the file as a string, which is passed to begin
    parsed into a DOM fragment.  (`angular.element()` could be used instead
    of `$()`)

*   **Creating an AngularJS Test Subject**  In most of our testing, it will be
    convenient to generate a DOM fragment that is a dynamic AngularJS app.
    This can be built out using the library's built-in compiler, (\$compile),
    linking it with a \$rootScope and then executing a single call to \$digest
    to initialize the directives.  Schematically, this looks like:

    ```javascript
    beforeEach(function(){
      inject(function($compile, $rootScope){
        globalElement = $compile( ...code... )($rootScope);
        $rootScope.$digest();
      });
    });
    ```

    Typical applications will combine these techniques to produce:

    ```javascript
    beforeEach(function(){
      module('index.html');
      inject(function($templateCache, $compile, $rootScope){
        globalPageVar = $compile($templateCache.get('index.html')($rootScope);
        $rootScope.$digest();
      });
    }
    ```

    Of course, if the code references modules, those modules must
    also be identified in the module declaration.  In many cases, you
    may wish to use test-specific initialization of the environment in 
    which the code operates.  In such a case, a function rather than a 
    `beforeEach` block may be used.  We shall see such examples in later
    katas.

### General TDD Techniques

Superheroic Tallying makes use of a number of TDD techniques that are
manifest in the code. These are very useful techniques of general
application worthy of mastery.

-   **Begin With an Empty File.** The less you constrain your
    application with templates and boilerplate code, the more free you
    are to make agile decisions and assure the broadest test coverage.
    The least constrained file, and the only one that requires no tests
    (other than to assure the development system is working) is an empty
    fie.

-   **The Outside-In Strategy.** For your first test, write a simple
    "happy path" integration test to flesh out the structure and basic
    behavior of your application. This tends to compel building the
    Walking Skeleton. When more is required to make a features test
    pass, drill "inside" to components, developed using unit tests, and
    return to the top level. Sometimes you may find it convenient to
    build a component in isolation, turning off testing of the whole
    system, until you have completed the component.

-   **The TDD Process.** Follow these three steps. Make them little
    steps. Repeat until you can't think of another test to write.
    When you can't think of another test to write, you are done.

    -   **Red -- Write a Little Test.** You may not write a single line of
        production code until you have written a failing test. The test must
        be the simplest test you can consider, and you should eschew writing
        more than one failing test at a time. I know you want to skip steps
        and write code. Don't do that. Exception: For these katas, we do not
        specify detailed design elements -- just the broad strokes of the
        display structure. We leave that to the designers for the most part,
        and they are free to add all the code necessary to realize their
        design, only requiring that they do not break the build.

    -   **Green -- Write a Little Code.** Once you have a failing test,
        write the `simplest thing that could possibly work.` Sometime you
        may make a test pass, but doing so makes other tests fail. This is a
        sign that it may be time to generalize.\
        I know you want to write general code right away when the test does
        not require it. Don't do that.

    -   **Refactor -- Clean up a Little Mess.** When the code is green, you
        are free to refactor the code *as well as the tests* for style or to
        make next tests easier to write. Do this early. Do this often. Then
        you have only little messes to clean up, and a test suite to support
        you. You can reshuffle and restructure the code all you like -- just
        do not add any new functionality.

-   **The Walking Skeleton.** First tests are always hard to write. When
    you start with nothing, you might focus your tests to compel
    building a "walking skeleton," the simplest deployable code that
    passes the current test suite. Often this is built using
    `Fake It Until You Make It`.

-   **Fake It Until You Make It.** Particularly at the outset of a test,
    you might find it best to simply write the assertion you ultimately
    want to see passing, and let the system lead you to building the
    `Walking Skeleton` or test setup. Such tests often result in compile
    errors rather than expectation failures. This is just fine. Instead
    of trying to make it pass all at once, simply write the minimum code
    to change the error message until you get to an expectation fail.

-   **The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work.** Don't write more
    code than is necessary to pass the test. Even if inserting a
    constant copied (we call this a `slime`) from the test is enough to
    make the test go green, don't generalize! Instead, write another
    test to force the generalization.

-   **Generalize When "Simpler Code" is Too Complex or Fails to advance
    the development.** When the simplest thing leads to greater
    complexity or does not move the development forward, it really isn't
    the "simplest thing" or something that could "possibly work." In
    this case, a more general transformation is used. That said, there
    is a growing sense that some generalizations are preferred over
    others, the so called [Transformation Priority Premise]
    (http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html).
    In his article, Uncle Bob suggests a useful list, from most preferred
    priority to least:

    -   The `slime`.
        -   ({}–\>nil) no code at all-\>code that employs nil
        -   (nil-\>constant)
        -   (constant-\>constant+) a simple constant to a more complex
            constant
    -   The `generalizing transforms`
        -   (constant-\>scalar) replacing a constant with a variable or
            an argument
        -   (statement-\>statements) adding more unconditional
            statements or changing the elements.
        -   (unconditional-\>if) splitting the execution path
        -   (scalar-\>array)
        -   (array-\>container)
        -   (statement-\>recursion)
        -   (if-\>while)
        -   (expression-\>function) replacing an expression with a
            function or algorithm
        -   (variable-\>assignment) replacing the value of a variable.

-   **As the Tests Gets More Specific, the Code Gets More Generic.**
    This mantra, proposed by Uncle Bob, is the consequence of all the
    foregoing.
